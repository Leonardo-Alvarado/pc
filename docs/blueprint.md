## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A soft violet (#9370DB) to establish a calm, authoritative feel. It will also work nicely with a dark color scheme.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated violet background (#F0EDF5). Its desaturation must be noticeable to clearly differentiate it from the primary color.
- Accent color: A vibrant blue-violet (#7080DB) that is roughly analogous, for highlights and active elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern look with some warmth.
- Use flat, line-based icons for a modern and clean aesthetic.
- Employ a consistent grid-based layout with rounded corners and sufficient whitespace.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as QR code scanning and data updates.
